# IDE Recommandations
You can use any of the following IDEs to develop mods for LuAria. These are optional, but I would **strongly recommand** using one of the code editors below, as these provide features like code completion, syntax highlighting and multiâ€‘cursor editing, and more:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Runestone](https://runestone.app)

## Visual Studio Code
This is by for the best IDE you can use to develop mods for LuAria but this is only recommanded for PC. We also recommand you get a lua extension for it

## Runestone
If you do not have a pc, this is the number `1` code editor I would recommand for iOS users.
This goes really really well with the files app.
