# Prerequisites 
Before you begin there are a few things you should be aware of. These tutorials build on each other—so work through them **in order** before moving ahead.

- Basic **Lua** knowledge, mods use [Lua](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/) as the scripting backend; you should know variables, functions, and tables.
- [LuAria](https://luaria.app) installed, The tool is injected into Terraria, lets you run mods, and ships with the Lua runtime.

If you’re new to Lua, start with the [official Lua tutorial](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html) before proceeding.

Once you are ready navagate to the loaders settings and enable `Modder Mode.` then please continue.
