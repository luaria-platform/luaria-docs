# Required Lua Libraries
LuAria is still in **early-beta**, and the Modding API (e.g. `ModPlayer`, `ModNPC`, etc.) is under active development, it's not yet bundled with the loader.

1. Download it [here](/)
2. Extract the contents into your mod project’s root directory so you can `require("ModPlayer")`, `require("ModNPC")`, and other modules.

:::note

In the upcoming stable release, this will be shipped automatically with **LuAria**—no extra download required.
