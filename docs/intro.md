# LuAria 

LuAria is a [Terraria](https://www.terraria.org) mobile mod loader and **modding platform** with a unique approach to mod development. Unlike other loaders, LuAria lets you build and test your mods directly at runtime—avoiding redundant recompilation and re-packaging. It re‑invents how Terraria mods are realized by using interpreted scripting languages such as Lua.

These docs are intended for **mod developers**. If you’re here just to *use* mods and not develop them, please visit our [homepage](https://luaria.app).

## Why LuAria?

Modding on mobile—especially iOS—has been locked down by strict sandboxing and security rules placed by Apple. LuAria works entirely **within** the platform’s constraints, giving you a powerful and **safe** way to mod your gameplay without resorting to hacks.

- **Self-sustainable modding**  
  Build, test and share your mods at runtime-no external tools needed.
- **No jailbreak or root**  
  Works on stock iOS & Android devices.

LuAria does all the heavy work—so you can spend your time building mods, not fighting stupid platform limits & restrictions.
